## About

A `dataplex-search-dq-scans` tool returns data quality scans that match the given criteria.
It's compatible with the following sources:

- [dataplex](../../sources/dataplex.md)

`dataplex-search-dq-scans` accepts the following optional parameters:

- `filter` - Filter string to search/filter data quality scans. E.g. "display_name = \"my-scan\"".
- `data_scan_id` - The resource name of the data scan to filter by: projects/{project}/locations/{locationId}/dataScans/{dataScanId}.
- `table_name` - The name of the table to filter by. Maps to data.entity in the filter string. E.g. "//bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/P/datasets/D/tables/T".
- `pageSize` - Number of returned data quality scans in the page. Defaults to `10`.
- `orderBy` - Specifies the ordering of results.

## Requirements

### IAM Permissions

Dataplex uses [Identity and Access Management (IAM)][iam-overview] to control
user and group access to Dataplex resources. Toolbox will use your
[Application Default Credentials (ADC)][adc] to authorize and authenticate when
interacting with [Dataplex][dataplex-docs].

In addition to [setting the ADC for your server][set-adc], you need to ensure
the IAM identity has been given the correct IAM permissions for the tasks you
intend to perform. See [Dataplex Universal Catalog IAM permissions][iam-permissions]
and [Dataplex Universal Catalog IAM roles][iam-roles] for more information on
applying IAM permissions and roles to an identity.
